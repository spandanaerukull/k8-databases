# this manifest creates a headless service and a StatefulSet for MongoDB in the 'roboshop' namespace.
# The headless service allows stable network identities for the MongoDB pods, while the StatefulSet manages the deployment and scaling of the MongoDB instances with persistent storage.

# normal service is created to allow applications to connect to the MongoDB pods easilysy
